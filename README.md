# Hi!

I'd like to welcome you for passing by here. It's really cool to see your interest in my work and I'd like to thank you for it.

There's some cool repos below such as 
- <strong>Help Me POC</strong>: which is a resource list for marginalized communities in Montreal compiled by members of those commuinities and translated in multiple languages using VueJS
- <strong>Iceland Flight Tracker</strong>: A fun use of the Iceland Flight api to track departures and arrivals (currently reskinning the app)
- & more to come!

I also will be hosting full interactive demos of the projects via hosting on Vercel/Netlify and aggregate these demos through my website csumm.github.io (under construction).

Aside from building websites for their functional purpose, I will also be including art assets and design repos along my code. As a current student in a full-time graphics course, it has breathed new air into my interest in building eye-pleasing and user-friendly website designs, and I want to share them with you to take a look and even use if you want.

If you have any questions or interested in working with me, message me at summers.carl@gmail.com, or drop a line as an issue on one of the repos with an identifier like: '[Reaching out] ...'.

Be sure to keep your eyes peeled for more projects, and thanks again for stopping by!
- Carl
